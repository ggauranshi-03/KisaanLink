# HyperCropChain

## About

HyperCropChain is a blockchain-based food supply chain project designed to facilitate end-to-end tracking of food crops from the farm to the consumer. The platform involves multiple stakeholders, including Admin, Farmer, and Operation Manager, to ensure transparency, traceability, and efficiency throughout the entire supply chain.

## Key Features

- **Farm-to-Consumer Tracking:** The system allows seamless tracking of food crops from the point of cultivation to the end consumer, providing a transparent and accountable supply chain.

- **Multiple Stakeholder Roles:**
  - *Admin:* Manages system access, ensures data integrity, and oversees the overall operation of the platform.
  - *Farmer:* Records crop-related information, such as planting, harvesting, and quality checks.
  - *Operation Manager:* Manages logistics, including transportation, storage, and distribution, ensuring timely delivery of crops.

## Tech Stack

- **Hyperledger Fabric:** The core blockchain framework that enables secure, permissioned transactions and data sharing among stakeholders.

- **Docker:** Containerization technology used to deploy and manage scalable and portable applications across different environments.

- **Node.js (Chaincode):** The backend logic is implemented using Node.js, providing a robust and efficient foundation for smart contracts (chaincode) execution.

- **Linux:** The project is hosted on Linux servers, ensuring a stable and secure environment for the blockchain network.

- **React.js:** The user interface is developed using React.js, providing a responsive and intuitive front-end experience for stakeholders to interact with the platform.

## Use Cases

1. **Traceability and Transparency:**
   - *Farmers* can input data related to crop cultivation, ensuring that every step is recorded on the blockchain.
   - *Consumers* gain access to detailed information about the origin, quality, and handling of the food they purchase.

2. **Quality Assurance:**
   - *Farmers* can document quality checks during various stages of cultivation.
   - *Operation Managers* can monitor and verify the quality of crops during transportation and storage.

3. **Supply Chain Optimization:**
   - *Operation Managers* can use the platform to optimize logistics, reducing delays and ensuring timely delivery.
   - *Admin* has an overview of the entire supply chain, enabling informed decision-making and process optimization.
